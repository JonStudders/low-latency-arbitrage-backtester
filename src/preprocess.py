def prepare_spread(df: pd.DataFrame, lookback: int = 60) -> pd.DataFrame:
  """
  Compute spread, rolling mean, std, and z-score between two assets.

  prepare_spread computes the price difference (spread) between two assets,
  along with the rolling average and a standardised "z-score" that indicates
  how unusual the current spread is compared to its recent history.

  Args:
    df : pd.DataFrame
      A pandas DataFrame with two columns, one for each asset.
    lookback : int, default = 60
      The number of past data points to use when calculating mean and std.

  Returns:
    pd.DataFrame
      The original dataframe with four new columns: spread, spread_mean, spread_std, and zscore.
